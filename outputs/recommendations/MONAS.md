## 2. Competitive Landscape
- Market gap analysis from the POV of the client's cafe
    - The Book Cafe concept strongly aligns with attracting book lovers, students, and remote workers through its theme, Wi-Fi, and electrical outlets. However, it currently has gaps in catering to commuters and travelers, particularly regarding quick service, luggage storage, and real-time travel information. Many competitors also close before midnight, leaving late-night travelers underserved.

    - **ANEKA 57:** Wifi unavailable, Limited Hours.

    - **Strengths:** Strong alignment with book lovers and library visitors, offering a unique ambiance for dine-in relaxation.
    - **Weaknesses:** Lack of explicitly stated operational hours, pricing, and ordering options limits accessibility and appeal to commuters. Limited menu may not satisfy all customers.
    - **Differentiation Score:** Medium - The book cafe theme provides some differentiation, but could be enhanced with clearer articulation of operational details and target demographic.

| High     | Operating factors | Extend operating hours to at least midnight, ideally 24 hours if feasible | The demographic analysis identifies late-night travelers as an underserved market.

| Low      | Concept / Theme   | Clearly state the target demographic in marketing materials.              | The client's SWOT identifies the lack of an explicitly stated target demographic as a weakness. This will improve messaging and marketing effectiveness.                                                                                                              |
