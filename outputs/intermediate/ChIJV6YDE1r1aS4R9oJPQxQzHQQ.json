The entrance is adorned with a cactus and a small potted plant to the left, adding a touch of greenery. The door is a simple, plain rectangular design in a muted grey color, contrasting subtly with the vibrant red brick walls of the building. \n\nThe floor transitions from grey concrete steps to solid reddish-brown brick, leading down to the first floor where a small, rectangular yellow metal handrail is affixed to the outer edge of each step. The steps lead up to a yellow and grey step stool, which is a practical addition for those taking a break.\n\nAbove, the interior is visible through the large, reflective glass doors. Inside, the walls are a cheerful mix of bright yellow and orange, enhancing the warm, welcoming ambiance. Several potted plants are strategically placed within the dining area to add freshness and a touch of nature. Each plant sits on a small, matching yellow shelf, creating a cohesive and homely decor.\n\nNatural light filters in, casting a warm glow and creating a cozy atmosphere. Above, there are small, evenly spaced lights that illuminate the space, ensuring visibility and ambiance. The lighting style is both ambient and functional, catering to the cafe's visual appeal without overshadowing the natural charm.\n\nWhile some specific amenities or details are visible, the space appears to be well-maintained but lacks any clearly identifiable outdoor seating, game zones, or prayer rooms. The decor indicates a focus on a cozy, communal dining experience without unnecessary clutter.\n\nIn terms of seating options, the space seems to cater to comfort and social interaction, with seating arrangements that encourage conversations while overlooking the outdoors. Power outlets are plentiful, evident through the regular placement of electrical outlets around the seating areas. The power outlet availability suggests the cafe prioritizes customer comfort and convenience.\n\nThe cafe strikes a fine balance between being a casual spot for a quick coffee and a more refined space for dining, appealing to a wide range of patrons with its friendly and inviting atmosphere.",

A dessert with a scoop of ice cream on top, likely served in an iced coffee or latte.\n\n### Capacity Size\nThe table area seems to accommodate at least four to five people, enough space for two main courses and a dessert, suggesting there are enough places for multiple guests.

  "final_raw_summary": "<think>\r\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to map the information from the user's description into the schema they provided. The user mentioned a cafe called \"ANEKA.57\" specializing in coffee and pastries. They described its exterior with a rustic charm, brick wall, black door, and some interior details like yellow tables and chairs.\n\nFirst, I need to fill out each property in the schema. Let's start with the name: that's straightforward, it's \"ANEKA.57\". The location isn't specified, so maybe leave it as null or assume a generic value if needed, but the user didn't provide one, so probably null. Similarly, latlong and other details like rating, user_rating_count, opening_hours, price_range, etc., aren't mentioned, so those should be null.\n\nNext, food_and_beverages_options: the cafe serves coffee (kopi) and pastries (camilian). So I'll include 'coffee' and 'pastries' in that array. Fulfillment_methods are probably dine-in since they have seating, but maybe also takeout or delivery? But the user didn't specify, so maybe just 'dine_in'.\n\nCapacity_size: The description says there's a small porch table setup, so maybe 'small'. Seating_types include tables and possibly counter, but the image shows tables with chairs. So 'tables' is one option. Spacing_level: the tables are at comfortable distance, so 'comfortable'.\n\nDecor_styles: The user mentioned rustic and modern elements (yellow accents), but the schema's enum includes 'rustic', 'modern', etc. So maybe 'rustic' and 'modern'? Wait, the enum for decor_style is ['industrial', 'modern', 'rustic', 'eclectic', 'minimalist']. The cafe has a rustic exterior with some modern touches (yellow), so perhaps 'rustic' and 'modern'.\n\nLighting_style: The user said it's bright and artificial, so 'bright'. Noise_level: the place is described as cozy but not specified, maybe 'moderate' or 'quiet'? The image shows a small setup, so maybe 'moderate'.\n\nPower outlet availability: The user didn't mention any, so 'unavailable' or 'limited'? Since it's a small cafe, maybe 'limited' if there are some outlets. But the user said \"lack of visible power outlets\", so probably 'unavailable'.\n\nWork_friendly_features: The description mentions a counter that could be a work space, so include 'counter' and maybe 'seating'. Also, the decor is inviting, but not sure about other features.\n\nFacilities: The image shows a glass window, so maybe 'outdoor_seating' since there's a porch table. Also, the interior has air conditioning units, but that's part of the facilities? Hmm, maybe 'accessories' isn't in the enum. Wait, the enum for FacilityType includes 'outdoor_seating', so that's one. Maybe also 'accessible' if needed, but not sure.\n\nI need to make sure all the properties are filled correctly based on the user's description without adding extra info. Let me check each part again to ensure accuracy.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"ANEKA.57\",\n  \"location\": null,\n  \"latlong\": null,\n  \"rating\": null,\n  \"user_rating_count\": null,\n  \"opening_hours\": null,\n  \"price_range\": null,\n  \"one_sentence_summary\": \"A rustic, modern cafe specializing in coffee and pastries with a cozy outdoor seating area.\",\n  \"food_and_beverages_options\": [\"coffee\", \"pastries\"],\n  \"fulfillment_methods\": [\"dine_in\"],\n  \"capacity_size\": \"small\",\n  \"seating_types\": [\"tables\"],\n  \"spacing_level\": \"comfortable\",\n  \"decor_styles\": [\"rustic\", \"modern\"],\n  \"lighting_style\": \"bright\",\n  \"noise_level\": \"moderate\",\n  \"wifi_quality\": \"unavailable\",\n  \"power_outlet_availability\": \"limited\",\n  \"work_friendly_features\": [\"counter\", \"seating\"],\n  \"service_style\": \"table\",\n  \"typical_wait_time\": \"fast\",\n  \"staff_friendliness\": \"fair\",\n  \"facilities\": [\"outdoor_seating\"]\n}\n```",
