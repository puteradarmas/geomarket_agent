The signboard features the following options:\n\n-  **TOKO KOPI TUKU (Kopi Store)**\n-  **POPOK BAYI PASTI MURAH (Cute Baby Tees at Cheap Prices)**\n-  **SUSU BAYI (Baby Milk)**\n-  **PASTI MURAH (Affordable)**\n\nFrom the visible space inside and the presence of the signboard, we can infer that the establishment likely operates as a small retail or market focusing on baby and baby-friendly products. There is no discernible indication of an outdoor seating area or specific amenities visible in the storefront itself. \n\nThe space inside looks quite small and enclosed, likely making it a relatively simple shop rather than a large market or store. The decor seems minimal, focusing on functional signs rather than an elaborate interior. The interior design is purely for functionality, with no apparent use of decorative elements. \n\nThere is no explicit lighting style or power outlets visible in the area captured by the image. Based on the visible elements, it doesn\u2019t appear to be a large or multifunctional space intended for extensive socializing or entertainment, which might exclude traditional features like outdoor seating. \n\nThe notable work-friendly feature, if there is one, is not depicted in this image, and there are no visible signs of large-scale charging stations or other such amenities commonly found in larger markets or convenience stores. The space appears to focus mainly on providing products rather than a service-oriented environment.",

The primary contents visible are coffee beans inside a transparent container, several bags of assorted coffee blends, jars of assorted teas or spices, and jars of honey or sugar. There are no visible signs of food, only beverage products. \n\nThere's a black crate on the floor storing these items. To the left and right, there is storage shelving that is partially visible. The floor appears to be tiled, which is typical for cafes.\n\nThe station is well-organized, and the items are neatly arranged. Each type of product has a clear label, making it easy to identify what each container contains. A small black stand is visible in the rear corner with items and storage. \n\nIn terms of space, the area seems spacious enough, given the amount of storage and the visible seating arrangement. However, there is no direct evidence provided about seating capacity. \n\nThere appears to be a single long bench, likely made of wood, that provides seating. There is no visible signage indicating the specific seating type, such as booth seats or tables with seating. \n\nThe station is at the front of a white cabinet or refrigerator, indicating the space available for serving beverages. The interior does not show any decorations or decor styles. \n\nBased on the visible components, it is difficult to assess the natural and artificial lighting levels. No obvious light fixtures are noticed in the frame, suggesting ambient or overhead lighting.\n\nThere are no visible charging stations or power outlets in the image. The lack of visible power outlets or related facilities suggests a lack of charging facilities in this area. \n\nThere are no evident features that indicate the space\u2019s readiness for work, such as specific amenities for workers. The visible station area, storage shelves, and seating arrangement offer a setup typical of a casual caf\u00e9. There are no visible features indicating a prayer room, a bookshelf, or a game area within this portion of the cafe.\n\nOverall, the setup appears to be standard for a beverage station in a casual caf\u00e9, with a focus on organization and visibility of products.",

The space is well-lit with several pendant lights hanging from the ceiling, providing both natural and artificial lighting. In the background, there are two baristas working, suggesting that this is a bustling area of the establishment. \n\nThe counter area is equipped with various coffee-making machines, including a large espresso machine and a automatic coffee maker, which are visible from the counter. These devices suggest that the shop offers a variety of coffee beverages. There are bottles and small glass containers placed on a wooden shelf at the front counter, indicating that the shop may also serve a range of beverages and possibly other refreshments.\n\nThe seating area includes multiple tables made of wood, arranged neatly to offer both personal and group seating. The counters themselves are made of wood, adding to the rustic yet modern aesthetic. Behind the counters, there is a glass display case that likely showcases the shop's baked goods, indicating a variety of menu items beyond just coffee.\n\nThe shop appears to be a small, cozy space, with minimal visible power outlets, which may cater to power-dependent devices such as mobile phones. The overall decor is minimalistic and clean, with elements that focus on functionality and a welcoming atmosphere. There are no visible outdoor seating, bookshelves, game areas, prayer rooms, or charging stations, suggesting a focus on a functional, coffee-focused environment.\n\nThe lighting style is utilitarian, with functional pendant lights ensuring good visibility without needing to turn on much artificial light. There is no obvious lack of lighting, so there are ample sources of illumination in the shop. While there are no definitive features indicating a prayer room or specific power outlets, the shop's structure appears functional without excessive features.\n\nOverall, the space seems designed primarily for patrons engaging in coffee services and not for significant dining or resting beyond the core menu.",

The visible options do not indicate specific food items or beverages. There are no visible signs indicating food service, suggesting the primary services offered are primarily beverages and possibly light snacks like pastries or sandwiches.\n\n**Capacity_Size:**\nThe visible space is relatively small, which could indicate limited capacity for seating. The space does not show a large, expansive layout that could host a busy coffee shop, implying it might be more suitable for a cozy, neighborhood coffee shop rather than a large chain or international chain.\n\n**Seating Types:**\nThe image shows a portion of the counter area where one can expect to order drinks. The counter appears narrow, which could suggest only a few seats, or it's possible that the seating arrangement is more casual and flexible, perhaps with stools facing the counter for quick coffee orders.\n\n**Spacing_Level:**\nFrom the visible parts of the counter and seating area, it appears that space between the counter and seating is minimal, likely to ensure a compact and close seating arrangement that maximizes the use of the limited space available.\n\n**Decor Styles:**\nThe visible part of the coffee shop is not a full display, so it\u2019s difficult to determine the decor style. However, the signage and general look seem typical for many local coffee shops with a clean and simple layout, which might favor contemporary or modern casual style.\n\n**Lighting Style:**\nThe image focuses on the signage and seems poorly lit.

  "final_raw_summary": "<think>\r\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a bunch of detailed observations about various coffee shops in the input and wants me to generate a structured JSON based on the given schema.\n\nFirst, I need to parse all the information from the inputs. Each input is a separate description of a cafe. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with the first input: It mentions \"Toko Kopi Tuku\" as the name. The food and beverages options are mainly drinks, maybe coffee and tea. Capacity size seems small because the space is narrow. Seating types are counter stools. Spacing level is minimal due to limited space. Decor style is modern and clean. Lighting style is dim, but there's a mention of natural light not being visible. Facilities don't include anything except the counter. Power outlets aren't mentioned, so probably unavailable. Work-friendly features are minimal since it's a casual spot.\n\nThen, the next input talks about \"Toko Kopi Tuku\" again with more details. It mentions coffee and tea as primary offerings. Capacity is small. Seating is counter-based. Spacing is cramped. Decor style is modern and clean. Lighting is dim. Facilities aren't specified. Power outlets are unavailable. Work-friendly features are none.\n\nAnother input describes a cafe named \"Toko Kopi Tuku\" with food options like pastries or sandwiches. Capacity is small. Seating types are counter. Spacing is minimal. Decor style is modern. Lighting is dim. No facilities, power outlets are limited. Work-friendly features are none.\n\nWait, there's a lot of repetition here. All the inputs seem to be about the same cafe named \"Toko Kopi Tuku\" with similar characteristics. The user might have multiple entries for this same location, but maybe they're different aspects or different times? Or perhaps it's the same place described in various ways. I need to make sure that each entry is properly categorized.\n\nLooking at the schema, I need to fill in the properties like name, capacity_size, seating_types, decor_styles, etc., based on the inputs. Also, note that some entries mention \"Toko Kopi Tuku\" but others are more general. For example, one input mentions a coffee shop named \"Toko Kopi Tuku,\" while another just says \"Toko Kopi Tuku\" without a name. Wait, no\u2014actually looking back, the first input in the user's messages is about a cafe with name \"Toko Kopi Tuku\", and other inputs might be different cafes or same.\n\nBut according to the given schema, each entry is for a specific cafe. However, all the inputs here seem to refer to the same place. But maybe they're separate descriptions of the same cafe. The user provided multiple entries with similar names but some variations. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the first input: \"Toko Kopi Tuku\" as name, capacity small, seating counter, decor modern, lighting dim. Then another input says same name, capacity small, etc. Another input mentions \"Toko Kopi Tuku\" again with different details\u2014like possibly including pastries or sandwiches in food options.\n\nSo, the user might have multiple entries for this cafe, but maybe they are separate scenarios or different aspects of the same place. However, since the task is to generate a JSON based on the schema, perhaps the answer should aggregate all these information into one entry, combining the details from each input.\n\nWait, but looking at the first input in the user's message, it says:\n\n\"### Description of the Image\n\n**Food and Beverages Options:**\nThe image depicts the signage of a coffee shop named \"Toko Kopi Tuku\". The visible options do not indicate specific food items or beverages. There are no visible signs indicating food service, suggesting the primary services offered are primarily beverages and possibly light snacks like pastries or sandwiches.\n\n**Capacity_Size:**\nThe visible space is relatively small, which could indicate limited capacity for seating.\"\n\nThen later in another input:\n\n\"### Description of the Image\n\n**Food and Beverages Options:**\nThe image depicts the signage of a coffee shop named \"Toko Kopi Tuku\". The visible options do not indicate specific food items or beverages. There are no visible signs indicating food service, suggesting the primary services offered are primarily beverages and possibly light snacks like pastries or sandwiches.\"\n\nSo, multiple entries about the same cafe, but varying in details. However, the user might want each of these to be separate entries? Or combine them into one?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's inputs are multiple different cafes, but all named \"Toko Kopi Tuku\". That seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps they're descriptions of the same caf\u00e9, and I need to aggregate the info.\n\nBut according to the schema, each entry in the JSON is a separate cafe profile. But since the user provided multiple entries for \"Toko Kopi Tuku,\" which could be the same place, but I need to check if that's allowed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and intended different cafes. However, given the information, it's possible they are describing the same shop with various aspects.\n\nBut looking at the schema, each entry is for a cafe. So perhaps all these inputs are separate entries for the same or different cafes.\n\nHowever, since the problem says \"based on the user's messages\", and the message includes multiple sections (like the first input, the second input, etc.), I need to process each of them as individual entries into the JSON structure.\n\nBut wait, the schema is for a single CafeProfile. However, the user might have provided multiple such objects. Wait, no\u2014the schema defines \"CafeProfile\" as an object. So perhaps the answer should be one object that combines all the information from the inputs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input is a separate cafe profile, and I need to create multiple entries. But the way the user provided the data, it's unclear if they are separate or not.\n\nBut given the repeated mention of \"Toko Kopi Tuku\" in each input, perhaps the user intended to describe one caf\u00e9 with various aspects, and the answer should be a single CafeProfile object aggregating all these details.\n\nSo I need to go through each input and extract the relevant information, then combine them into one cafe profile.\n\nLet me list out what each input says:\n\nFirst input (Toko Kopi Tuku):\n\n- Name: Toko Kopi Tuku\n- Food and Beverages Options: coffee, tea, possibly pastries/sandwiches\n- Capacity Size: small\n- Seating Types: counter\n- Spacing Level: cramped or minimal (from the description)\n- Decor Styles: modern, clean\n- Lighting Style: dim\n- Facilities: none specified (no facilities like prayer room, etc.)\n- Power Outlets: limited or unavailable? The first input says \"power_outlet_availability\" is not mentioned but in another part, it's said that power outlets are available. Wait no\u2014looking back:\n\nIn one of the inputs, under \"Power Outlet Availability\": \"There are no visible power outlets or any related indicators in the image.\" So that would be 'unavailable' or 'limited'? But in another input, it says \"power_outlet_availability\" is abundant. Wait, need to check all the inputs.\n\nLooking back:\n\nIn the first input: \"Power Outlet Availability: There are no visible power outlets or any related indicators in the image.\" So that's 'unavailable'.\n\nAnother input says: \"Power outlet availability appears to be abundant, as there are multiple outlets available for customer use.\"\n\nSo depending on which input we're taking, but since all entries are about the same place, perhaps it's a mix. However, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input is a different description of the same cafe. So, combining all the details:\n\nName: Toko Kopi Tuku\n\nFood and Beverages Options: coffee, tea, possible pastries/sandwiches (from first input), possibly other items like light snacks (from another part).\n\nCapacity Size: small.\n\nSeating Types: counter (as per some inputs), but in others mention stools facing the counter. So seating type is 'counter'.\n\nSpacing Level: cramped or minimal (depending on which input).\n\nDecor Styles: modern and clean (as per multiple inputs).\n\nLighting Style: dim (from first input) or natural? Wait, one input says \"natural light is not visible\", so maybe dim.\n\nFacilities: none specified, but in another part it mentions no facilities like prayer rooms, bookshelves, etc. So Facilities would be empty array.\n\nPower Outlets: some inputs say unavailable, others say abundant. This seems conflicting. But looking at the original input:\n\nIn one of the entries, under \"Power Outlet Availability\": \"There are no visible power outlets or any related indicators in the image.\" So that's 'unavailable'.\n\nAnother input says: \"power_outlet_availability appears to be abundant\". Wait, but that might be from a different description. However, since all inputs are for the same cafe, perhaps it's conflicting.\n\nBut given that one of the entries says there are no visible outlets, which is more concrete, maybe we take that as 'unavailable'.\n\nWork-friendly features: none, as per most inputs.\n\nService style: counter (from some descriptions).\n\nSo putting this together into the schema:\n\nname: \"Toko Kopi Tuku\"\n\nfood_and_beverages_options: [\"coffee\", \"tea\", \"pastries\", \"sandwiches\"] (assuming from the description)\n\ncapacity_size: 'small'\n\nseating_types: ['counter']\n\nspacing_level: 'cramped' or 'minimal'? From one input it's said that spacing is minimal due to limited space, but another says cramped. Might need to choose based on the most consistent info.\n\ndecor_styles: [\"modern\", \"clean\"]\n\nlighting_style: \"dim\"\n\nfacilities: [] (no specific facilities mentioned)\n\npower_outlet_availability: 'unavailable' (from one of the inputs)\n\nwork_friendly_features: []\n\nBut wait, some other input mentions that in another scenario, power outlets are abundant. But maybe that's a mistake or a different description.\n\nAlternatively, since there is conflicting information, perhaps we take the most explicit one, which says \"no visible power outlets\", so 'unavailable'.\n\nAlso, need to check if any of the inputs mention specific service styles. The first input mentions \"counter stools\" as seating, but service style might be 'counter'. Another input says \"service style: counter\".\n\nSo compiling all this into the JSON structure.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"Toko Kopi Tuku\",\n  \"food_and_beverages_options\": [\"coffee\", \"tea\", \"pastries\", \"sandwiches\"],\n  \"capacity_size\": \"small\",\n  \"seating_types\": [\"counter\"],\n  \"spacing_level\": \"cramped\",\n  \"decor_styles\": [\"modern\", \"clean\"],\n  \"lighting_style\": \"dim\",\n  \"facilities\": [],\n  \"power_outlet_availability\": \"unavailable\",\n  \"work_friendly_features\": []\n}"
