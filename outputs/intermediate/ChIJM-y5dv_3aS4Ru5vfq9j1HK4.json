Let me start by going through each part of their description and map it to the appropriate fields in the schema.\n\nFirst, the name of the cafe isn't mentioned, so maybe leave that as null or not include it? But the schema allows for null, so I'll put it as null unless specified.\n\nNext, latlong and location are also not given, so they can be null. Rating and user_rating_count aren't provided either, so those will be null too. Opening hours and price range aren't mentioned, so again, null.\n\nThe one-sentence summary is a bit tricky. The user described it as a casual dining or meeting space with outdoor seating. So maybe \"Casual dining and meeting space with outdoor seating.\" That fits the one-sentence summary.\n\nFood and beverages options: The user mentioned coffee, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and cocktails. Wait, in the first input, they said \"coffee\" and \"breakfast\", but later there was a mention of beer and wine. Let me check again. In the inputs, there's a part where they mention \"coffee, breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, desserts, beer, wine, cocktails, vegetarian\". So I should include all these as service types.\n\nFulfillment methods: The user talked about dine-in, takeout, delivery, and curbside pickup. So those are the fulfillment methods.\n\nCapacity size: In one of the inputs, it was described as \"ample\", so that would map to 'large' in the CapacitySize enum.\n\nSeating types: They mentioned metal chairs with cushions, small square tables. The seating type here is 'tables', and maybe 'counter'? Wait, the user said \"seating includes metal chairs... around small square tables\". So the seating types are 'tables' and possibly 'couches'? But in the schema, SeatingType has options like counter, tables, couches, communal, booths. The input doesn't mention couches or booths, so maybe just 'tables'.\n\nSpacing level: They mentioned \"moderate\" spacing, so that's 'comfortable' in the SpacingLevel enum.\n\nDecor styles: The user described it as modern and minimalistic? Let me check. In one of the inputs, they said \"modern, with a combination of industrial metal frames... and perhaps some greenery\". So maybe 'modern' and 'minimalist'? Or just 'modern'?\n\nLighting style: They mentioned natural light from large windows, so that's 'natural'.\n\nNoise level: The user didn't specify, but in the input, there was mention of \"moderate\" spacing. Maybe 'quiet' or 'moderate'? Wait, another input said \"light fixtures above some tables, but they appear to be functional rather than aesthetic additions.\" So maybe the noise level is 'moderate'? Or 'quiet'? The user didn't explicitly say, but since it's a casual place, perhaps 'quiet'.\n\nWiFi quality: Not mentioned, so null.\n\nPower outlet availability: In one input, it said \"power outlets are rare\" and in another, they were not visible. So that would be 'limited' or 'unavailable'? The user said \"rare\" which might mean limited, but maybe 'unavailable' if not present? But the schema's AvailabilityLevel includes 'unavailable', so perhaps 'unavailable'.\n\nWork-friendly features: They didn't mention any specific work features like charging stations, meeting rooms, etc. So this field could be empty or null.\n\nService style: The user mentioned \"dine-in\", \"takeout\", \"delivery\", \"curbside_pickup\". But service style is either counter, table, self_serve, mixed. Since it's a cafe with tables, maybe 'table'?\n\nTypical wait time: Not specified, so maybe null.\n\nStaff friendliness: Not mentioned, so null.\n\nFacilities: They mentioned outdoor seating, so that's 'outdoor_seating'.\n\nNow I need to map all these into the schema structure.
