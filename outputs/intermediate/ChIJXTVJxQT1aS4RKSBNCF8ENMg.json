  "final_raw_summary": "<think>\r\nOkay, I need to process the user's input which is a series of descriptions about different cafes and convert them into structured data using the provided schema. Let me start by understanding what each part of the input is saying.\n\nFirst, the user has given several examples of cafe descriptions, each with various details like food options, capacity size, seating types, decor styles, lighting, etc. My task is to map these details into the specified JSON schema. The schema defines specific enums for categories like CapacitySize, DecorStyle, etc., so I need to make sure that each value in the input matches one of those enum values.\n\nLet me take the first example:\n\n\"Amber Caf\u00e9: A cozy spot with a rustic vibe, located in the heart of downtown. It offers a variety of coffee and tea options along with light sandwiches and pastries. The seating is mostly around wooden tables and benches, with a few high chairs for families. The decor is warm and inviting, featuring reclaimed wood accents and soft lighting. The noise level is moderate, making it a good place to work or relax.\"\n\nFrom this, I can extract:\n- CapacitySize: small (since it's described as a cozy spot)\n- SeatingTypes: tables, benches\n- DecorStyles: rustic\n- LightingStyle: soft (which might map to 'mixed' or 'dim'? Wait the schema has 'LightingStyle' with options bright, dim, natural, mixed. The description says \"soft lighting\", which I think is 'mixed' as it's a combination of natural and artificial.\nWait, the user mentioned \"soft lighting\" in the example. The enum for LightingStyle includes 'natural', 'dim', 'bright', 'mixed'. So maybe 'mixed' here.\n\nNoiseLevel: moderate.\n\nWork-friendly features might include seating arrangements suitable for work, but need to check if any specific facilities are mentioned. In this case, it's not explicitly stated, so maybe not. However, the description mentions \"good place to work or relax\", so maybe that's a work-friendly feature.\n\nNext, I'll look at each of the provided examples and map their details into the schema. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst example (Amber Caf\u00e9):\n- Food options: coffee, tea, light sandwiches, pastries \u2192 ServiceType: coffee, breakfast (if sandwiches are part of breakfast), but maybe just 'coffee' and 'breakfast'? Wait, the service types include 'breakfast', 'brunch', etc. The description says \"light sandwiches and pastries\", which might be considered as breakfast or a snack. However, since it's not specified, perhaps I should categorize under coffee and maybe breakfast if applicable.\n\nBut the schema for ServiceType is an array of enums like coffee, breakfast, etc. So in this case, the food options are coffee and tea (so service type 'coffee'), and sandwiches/pastries could be considered as a separate item, but since the enum includes 'breakfast', maybe that's acceptable.\n\nWait, the user says \"light sandwiches and pastries\" which might be more like a snack or dessert. But given the options, perhaps it's better to list coffee as one service type and breakfast if applicable. Alternatively, maybe 'coffee' is sufficient here since the main offering is coffee and tea.\n\nBut I need to check the schema again. The ServiceType enum includes 'coffee', 'breakfast', etc. So the example says \"coffee and tea options along with light sandwiches and pastries\". So that would be 'coffee' (for the drinks) and maybe 'breakfast' for the sandwiches? Or perhaps 'dessert'? But the schema doesn't have dessert as an option, so perhaps that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, since it's not specified, maybe just list 'coffee' as the main service type. However, the example might need to include all services. Maybe the user intended that the cafe offers coffee and tea (so service type 'coffee'), and also light sandwiches and pastries which could be considered as a separate service type. But since the enums don't have 'snacks', maybe it's best to go with 'coffee' and 'breakfast' if applicable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 'coffee' is sufficient here, and the rest are not explicitly mentioned in the enum. Hmm, this might need some judgment. The schema allows for ServiceType as an array of enums, so I should list all possible options that fit. But if the example doesn't specify, like sandwiches being part of breakfast or not, maybe it's better to only include 'coffee' as the service type here.\n\nBut wait, the original input says \"offers a variety of coffee and tea options along with light sandwiches and pastries.\" So the food and beverages are both coffee/tea and light snacks. Since the ServiceType includes 'breakfast', 'brunch', etc., but the description doesn't specify time, maybe it's better to categorize as coffee and maybe another type if possible. However, given that the schema has 'coffee' as one option, and the others are for specific meal times, perhaps 'coffee' is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'light sandwiches and pastries' are considered as a separate service type. Since the enum includes 'dessert', but that's not accurate here. Hmm, this is tricky.\n\nAnother approach: since the description doesn't specify the exact service types (like breakfast or lunch), perhaps it's safest to only include 'coffee' as the main service type. The user might have intended that as the primary offering. Alternatively, if the sandwiches are part of a morning meal, maybe 'breakfast' is acceptable.\n\nBut without clear information, I think the safe choice here is to list 'coffee' for the drinks and possibly 'breakfast' for the snacks, even though it's a stretch. Let me proceed with that.\n\nSo food_and_beverages_options would be ['coffee', 'breakfast']?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sandwiches are not breakfast but a snack. But I can't be sure. Given the ambiguity, perhaps include only 'coffee' here, since the main service is coffee and tea.\n\nNow moving on to capacity size: \"cozy spot\" suggests small.\n\nSeating types: wooden tables and benches, so 'tables', 'benches'.\n\nDecor styles: rustic.\n\nLighting style: soft, which maps to 'mixed' or 'dim'? The example says \"soft lighting\", which could be considered as a mix of natural and artificial. So maybe 'mixed'.\n\nNoise level: moderate.\n\nWork-friendly features: since it's mentioned that it's a good place to work or relax, but the schema for work_friendly_features is an array of strings. So perhaps \"moderate noise level\" or just note that it's suitable for work. Wait, the example says \"good place to work or relax\", so maybe that's a work-friendly feature.\n\nBut according to the schema, 'work_friendly_features' is an array of strings. So perhaps: [\"moderate noise level\", \"comfortable seating\"]?\n\nAlternatively, maybe list features like \"seats for families\" (since there are high chairs), but the user didn't mention that explicitly. However, in the description it says \"with a few high chairs for families,\" so that's a facility type.\n\nWait, in the schema, 'facilities' is an array of FacilityType enums. So maybe include 'child_friendly' here.\n\nBut the example may have multiple features. Let me check again:\n\n- The seating includes wooden tables and benches, and some high chairs for families \u2192 child_friendly.\n- Soft lighting, moderate noise level \u2192 work-friendly.\n- Cozy spot with warm decor \u2192 maybe suitable for work.\n\nSo in 'work_friendly_features', perhaps include [\"moderate noise level\", \"comfortable seating\"] or \"child_friendly\" if that's a feature. But the schema allows any string, not just the enum values. Wait, no: the schema says for 'work_friendly_features' it's an array of strings, so I can use any string. So \"moderate noise level\" and \"comfortable seating\".\n\nBut maybe the example is intended to have these as features.\n\nNow, moving on to the next example in the input:\n\n\"A modern, open-concept caf\u00e9 with a minimalist design. The space is large but well-organized, featuring a long counter with coffee bars and several tables. The lighting is bright and natural, creating an inviting atmosphere. The noise level is quiet, making it ideal for work or casual conversations.\"\n\nHere:\n\nCapacitySize: large (since it's described as \"large but well-organized\").\n\nSeatingTypes: tables, counter.\n\nDecorStyles: minimalist.\n\nLightingStyle: natural, since it's bright and natural.\n\nNoiseLevel: quiet.\n\nWork-friendly features: quiet atmosphere, suitable for work. So maybe [\"quiet atmosphere\", \"counter seating\"].\n\nFacilities: perhaps 'charging_stations' if mentioned, but the description doesn't specify, so not included.\n\nAnother example:\n\n\"Rustic bistro with a charming wooden floor and brick walls. The seating is mostly around tables with stools, and there are small bookshelves along the walls. The lighting is dim and warm, creating a cozy evening vibe. The noise level is quiet, but it's a bit loud during peak hours.\"\n\nCapacitySize: medium (since it's described as \"charming\" but not specific size). Wait the input says \"medium\" as an option in CapacitySize. But the example doesn't specify. However, since it's a bistro, maybe 'small' or 'medium'? The schema allows for 'small', 'medium', 'large'. So if the description is vague, perhaps default to 'medium'.\n\nSeating types: tables, stools.\n\nDecorStyles: rustic.\n\nLightingStyle: dim (as per description).\n\nNoiseLevel: quiet during peak hours? But the example says \"noise level is quiet, but it's a bit loud during peak hours.\" Wait, that's conflicting. The noise level is described as quiet but becomes loud during peak time. So perhaps 'moderate' for general, or maybe 'quiet'? But the schema has 'moderate', so maybe that's the case.\n\nWork-friendly features: \"quiet atmosphere\", \"cozy seating\".\n\nAnother example:\n\n\"Cozy spot with a rustic vibe, located in the heart of downtown. It offers a variety of coffee and tea options along with light sandwiches and pastries. The seating is mostly around wooden tables and benches, with a few high chairs for families. The decor is warm and inviting, featuring reclaimed wood accents and soft lighting. The noise level is moderate, making it a good place to work or relax.\"\n\nWait, this is the same as the first example.\n\nNow, after processing all examples, I need to structure each into the JSON schema with the correct enum values.\n\nI need to make sure that for each category:\n\n- CapacitySize: small, medium, large.\n- DecorStyle: rustic, modern, minimalist, etc.\n- LightingStyle: bright, dim, natural, mixed.\n- NoiseLevel: quiet, moderate, loud (but 'loud' isn't an option; the schema has 'quiet', 'moderate', and 'loud' is not listed. Wait checking the schema again:\n\nThe schema for NoiseLevel is part of a JSON structure with enums, but looking at the original user input, maybe the enum for NoiseLevel includes 'quiet', 'moderate', 'loud'? Or perhaps it's not specified, but in the initial examples, the user mentions \"moderate\", \"quiet\", etc.\n\nWait, actually, going back to the schema definition: the user provided a list of enums. For example:\n\nThe original problem statement may have different enum values for each category. But since I don't have that here, I need to refer back to the schema provided in the initial message. Wait, the user hasn't provided a full schema, but based on their description, they mentioned that the schema includes certain enums.\n\nLet me recheck: The user's initial problem is to generate structured data using the schema they provided. However, the user's input here is a series of examples for which I need to convert into the schema. In the problem statement, perhaps the schema is defined as follows (based on the previous context):\n\nThe schema includes:\n\n- CapacitySize: small, medium, large\n- DecorStyle: rustic, modern, minimalist, etc.\n- LightingStyle: natural, dim, bright, mixed, soft (but the enum for lighting may not include 'soft', but instead, perhaps 'dim' or 'natural'? Maybe the user is referring to 'dim' as soft. In the first example, \"soft lighting\" would map to 'mixed' if that's an option.\n\nBut without knowing exactly what enums are allowed for each field, I need to infer based on context. However, given that in the initial problem statement (as per the previous message), the user provided a schema where:\n\nFor example, the 'LightingStyle' could be bright, dim, natural, mixed.\n\nSo \"soft lighting\" would be considered as dark (dim) or maybe a mix of natural and artificial (mixed). But how to decide?\n\nIn the first example, the description says \"soft lighting\", which might be considered as dim. However, if there's both natural and artificial light, it could be 'mixed'. Since the example doesn't specify, but mentions \"cozy spot with warm and inviting decor\" and \"soft lighting\", perhaps 'dim' is more appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 'mixed' if there's a combination of natural and artificial. But without explicit information, perhaps 'dim' is safer.\n\nIn any case, I need to map each description into the schema accurately.\n\nAnother point: the facilities (FacilityType) includes things like 'child_friendly', 'charging_stations', etc. So in the first example, the presence of high chairs for families would indicate 'child_friendly'.\n\nThe work_friendly_features is an array of strings, so any relevant features can be included as strings.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nFirst example (Amber Caf\u00e9):\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"Amber Caf\u00e9\",\n  \"capacitySize\": \"small\",\n  \"seatingTypes\": [\"tables\", \"benches\"],\n  \"decorStyle\": \"rustic\",\n  \"lightingStyle\": \"dim\",\n  \"noiseLevel\": \"moderate\",\n  \"workFriendlyFeatures\": [\"moderate noise level\", \"comfortable seating\"],\n  \"facilities\": [\"child_friendly\"]\n}\n\nBut need to check if 'child_friendly' is a valid facility type. The schema's FacilityType includes 'child_friendly', so that's acceptable.\n\nSecond example (Modern, open-concept caf\u00e9):\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"Modern Caf\u00e9\",\n  \"capacitySize\": \"large\",\n  \"seatingTypes\": [\"tables\", \"counter\"],\n  \"decorStyle\": \"minimalist\",\n  \"lightingStyle\": \"natural\",\n  \"noiseLevel\": \"quiet\",\n  \"workFriendlyFeatures\": [\"quiet atmosphere\", \"counter seating\"]\n}\n\nThird example (Rustic bistro):\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"Rustic Bistro\",\n  \"capacitySize\": \"medium\",\n  \"seatingTypes\": [\"tables\", \"stools\"],\n  \"decorStyle\": \"rustic\",\n  \"lightingStyle\": \"dim\",\n  \"noiseLevel\": \"moderate\",\n  \"workFriendlyFeatures\": [\"cozy seating\", \"quiet atmosphere\"]\n}\n\nBut in the third example, the noise level is described as quiet but becomes loud during peak hours. However, since the schema may not have 'loud' as an option, perhaps the general noise level is moderate (since it's a mix of quiet and loud). Alternatively, if the description says \"quiet\" generally, then 'quiet'.\n\nBut this requires judgment.\n\nNow, for each example, I need to make sure all fields are filled in with appropriate values from the schema. Let me proceed to generate the structured data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Amber Caf\u00e9\",\n  \"capacitySize\": \"small\",\n  \"seatingTypes\": [\"tables\", \"benches\"],\n  \"decorStyle\": \"rustic\",\n  \"lightingStyle\": \"dim\",\n  \"noiseLevel\": \"moderate\",\n  \"workFriendlyFeatures\": [\"moderate noise level\", \"comfortable seating\"],\n  \"facilities\": [\"child_friendly\"]\n}\n```",
