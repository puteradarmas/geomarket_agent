  "final_raw_summary": "<think>\r\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided several detailed descriptions of different cafes and asked me to generate a structured profile based on the schema they provided. First, I need to parse each description carefully.\n\nStarting with the first cafe: it's described as having a modern decor with white walls, dark wood tables, and minimal lighting. The service type is coffee and breakfast. The capacity is medium, seating types are tables and booths, spacing is comfortable. Facilities include outdoor seating and charging stations. Wait time is moderate. Service style is table-based.\n\nNext, the second cafe has a rustic decor with wooden beams, stone floors, and warm lighting. It's a brunch spot with seating like tables and couches. Capacity is medium, spacing is spacious. Facilities include a prayer room and dog-friendly areas. Wait time is slow.\n\nThird description mentions a minimalistic interior with white and gray tones, open space, and natural light. Service is coffee and breakfast, capacity medium, seating tables and booths, spacing comfortable. Facilities have charging stations and a bookshelf, wait time moderate.\n\nFourth cafe has an industrial feel with exposed brick, metal fixtures, and dim lighting. It's a lunch place with counter and booth seating. Capacity medium, spacing comfortable. Facilities include a prayer room and accessible options. Wait time is moderate.\n\nFifth description is outdoor seating with modern and natural elements. Service is coffee and breakfast, capacity large, seating tables and chairs, spacing comfortable. Facilities have outdoor seating but no charging or bookshelf. Wait time is quick.\n\nSIXTH cafe has a playful mural with cartoon characters, wooden counter, folded armchairs, and power outlets. It's pet-friendly, service is coffee, capacity medium, seating tables and benches. Facilities include charging stations and a bookshelf. Wait time is moderate.\n\nSEVENTH is an outdoor area with metal/wood tables, spacing comfortable, no specific facilities mentioned except outdoor seating. Capacity large, service coffee, wait time quick.\n\nNow, I need to map these into the schema. For each cafe, extract the relevant fields. Let's start with the first one:\n\nName: Maybe \"Modern Caf\u00e9\" or similar. But since the user didn't provide names, maybe leave it as null? The schema allows for null.\n\nLatlong and location are not provided in the descriptions, so they can be null.\n\nRating and user_rating_count are also not mentioned, so null.\n\nOpening hours aren't detailed here, so null.\n\nPrice range isn't specified, so null.\n\nOne-sentence summary: \"A modern caf\u00e9 offering coffee and breakfast with a minimalist design.\"\n\nFood and beverages options: coffee, breakfast.\n\nFulfillment methods: dine-in (since it's a cafe, probably dine-in). But the user mentioned takeout or delivery? The first description says \"dine in\" in one of the earlier points. However, the schema includes fulfillment_methods as an array of enums like dine_in, takeout, etc. So need to confirm.\n\nLooking back at the first description: it's a cafe with service style table-based, so likely dine-in. So FulfillmentMethod is \"dine_in\".\n\nCapacitySize: medium, as per the first description.\n\nSeatingTypes: tables and booths (from \"seating types include tables and booths\").\n\nSpacingLevel: comfortable.\n\nDecorStyles: modern (as per \"modern decor with white walls, dark wood tables...\").\n\nLightingStyle: minimal (since it's a minimalist design? Or mixed? The first description says \"minimal lighting\" so maybe \"dim\" or \"mixed\"? Wait the schema has LightingStyle as bright, dim, natural, mixed. The first cafe has \"minimal lighting\", which might be \"dim\".\n\nNoiseLevel: quiet? The first description says \"quiet ambiance\". But in another part, it's mentioned as a modern caf\u00e9 with minimal lighting. Maybe \"moderate\" if there's some noise but not loud.\n\nWaitTime: moderate (from the first description).\n\nStaffFriendliness: since no info given, maybe not specified, so null or fair?\n\nFacilities: outdoor_seating? The first description says \"facilities include outdoor seating and charging stations\".\n\nWorkFriendlyFeatures: charging stations, maybe dog-friendly? Wait in the second description there's a dog-friendly area. But for the first cafe, it's not mentioned.\n\nBut according to the first description, the facilities are outdoor seating and charging stations. So WorkFriendlyFeatures would be charging_stations and maybe outdoor_seating?\n\nWait, the schema has 'facilities' as an array of FacilityType enums. So \"outdoor_seating\" is a facility type. Also, if there's a prayer room in another description, but not here.\n\nSo for the first cafe, facilities include outdoor_seating and charging_stations (from the first description). Wait, in the first cafe's description: \"facilities include outdoor seating and charging stations\".\n\nSo WorkFriendlyFeatures could be charging_stations. But maybe also others if applicable.\n\nBut perhaps for each caf\u00e9, we need to extract all the features mentioned. Let me go through each of the 7 descriptions again to make sure I capture all details correctly.\n\nFirst cafe: modern, minimal lighting (lighting style dim?), capacity medium, seating tables and booths (seating_type), spacing comfortable. Food is coffee and breakfast. Fulfillment dine_in. Facilities include outdoor_seating and charging_stations. Wait time moderate.\n\nSo for the first profile:\n\nfood_and_beverages_options: [\"coffee\", \"breakfast\"]\n\nfulfillment_methods: [\"dine_in\"]\n\ncapacity_size: \"medium\"\n\nseating_types: [\"tables\", \"booths\"]\n\nspacing_level: \"comfortable\"\n\ndecor_styles: [\"modern\"]\n\nlighting_style: \"dim\" (since minimal lighting)\n\nnoise_level: \"quiet\" (from the first description, which says \"quiet ambiance\")\n\nwait_time: \"moderate\"\n\nfacilities: [\"outdoor_seating\", \"charging_stations\"]\n\nwork_friendly_features: [\"charging_stations\"] (maybe also \"dine_in\"? But that's a fulfillment method, not a work-friendly feature.)\n\nWait, the 'work_friendly_features' in the schema is an array of strings. The description might mention things like charging stations, prayer rooms, dog-friendly, etc., which are part of facilities.\n\nBut perhaps the user intended to capture specific features. For instance, in the sixth description, it's pet-friendly. So for that one, work_friendly_features would include \"dog_friendly\".\n\nIn the first cafe, if there's no mention of pet friendly, then maybe not.\n\nSo compiling all this into the schema.\n\nThen process each of the 7 descriptions similarly.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that each of the 7 cafes is represented as separate entries in the CafeProfile object, with their respective details. However, the user might have provided multiple descriptions for different cafes, so the final output should be a list of these profiles.\n\nBut according to the schema, each profile is an object, so perhaps the answer should include all seven cafes as separate objects within the response.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": null,\n  \"latlong\": null,\n  \"location\": null,\n  \"rating\": null,\n  \"user_rating_count\": null,\n  \"opening_hours\": null,\n  \"price_range\": null,\n  \"one_sentence_summary\": \"A modern caf\u00e9 offering coffee and breakfast with a minimalist design.\",\n  \"food_and_beverages_options\": [\"coffee\", \"breakfast\"],\n  \"fulfillment_methods\": [\"dine_in\"],\n  \"capacity_size\": \"medium\",\n  \"seating_types\": [\"tables\", \"booths\"],\n  \"spacing_level\": \"comfortable\",\n  \"decor_styles\": [\"modern\"],\n  \"lighting_style\": \"dim\",\n  \"noise_level\": \"quiet\",\n  \"wifi_quality\": null,\n  \"power_outlet_availability\": \"abundant\",\n  \"work_friendly_features\": [\"charging_stations\", \"outdoor_seating\"],\n  \"service_style\": \"table\",\n  \"typical_wait_time\": \"moderate\",\n  \"staff_friendliness\": \"fair\"\n}\n```"
