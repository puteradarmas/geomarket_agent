    "b491f4e532b31263dc02e37602de279c55230529c7756ad17d8f807f40ffb4fa": "This image depicts a quaint outdoor caf\u00e9 or restaurant with a charming and classic aesthetic. \n\n### Food and Beverages Options\nThe visible outdoor seating area is relatively empty, making it challenging to discern specific food and beverage offerings immediately. However, the presence of tables and chairs suggests that the caf\u00e9 likely serves various dishes and beverages.\n\n### Capacity Size\nBased on the visible outdoor seating area, which includes several tables with chairs and a series of white potted plants, it appears that the caf\u00e9 can accommodate a moderate number of patrons. The exact capacity size cannot be definitively determined without more information, but it is reasonable to assume it can handle up to 10 to 12 people.\n\n### Seating Types\nThe seating area predominantly consists of wooden outdoor tables and chairs, which is typical for outdoor cafes aimed at a casual atmosphere. The tables are likely made of wood or a similar material, and the chairs seem to have cushioned seats.\n\n### Spacing Level\nThe spacing between tables and chairs is ample, with enough space for patrons to comfortably move around and have a clear view of the outdoor surroundings. There is no evidence of overcrowding.\n\n### Decor Styles\nThe decor style is highly classic, with ornate metalwork for the hanging chandeliers, wooden beams and columns, and an overall sense of historical charm that suggests a focus on maintaining aesthetics from a previous era.\n\n### Lighting Style\nThe lighting in the outdoor area seems to combine both natural light and artificial lighting from the chandeliers and potentially other light fixtures. The chandeliers add a touch of elegance and contribute to the ambient lighting atmosphere.\n\n### Facilities and Amenities\nOutdoor Seating: Outdoor seating tables and chairs for patrons to dine al fresco.\n\n### Power Outlet Availability\nThe power outlet availability is not observable in the image. However, given the traditional and elegant nature of the caf\u00e9, it is plausible that tables with built-in power outlets have been provided, although this is speculative without further visual confirmation.\n\n### Notable Work-Friendly Features\nThe setting is relatively work-friendly as it encourages outdoor activities with a comfortable seating arrangement for those who need a break or informal meeting place.\n\nThis is a classic and picturesque outdoor cafe area designed for both leisure and work purposes, offering an inviting and aesthetically pleasing environment.",

The snack on the left is golden brown and appears to be breaded, possibly onion rings or calamari, accompanied by a small bowl of a dipping sauce garnished with green herbs.\n  - The snack on the right is more irregular in shape, possibly a type of deep-fried appetizer, and is garnished with a vibrant topping that includes red and green seasonings. There is also a small garnish of green herbs, suggesting it could be a type of fried seafood, such as crawfish or shrimp.\n\n- **Capacity and Seating Arrangement**:\n  - The image does not provide enough detail to accurately determine the seating capacity or arrangement of the cafe. However, the visible space suggests that the environment is designed to accommodate multiple guests comfortably.\n\n- **Seating Types and Spacing**:\n  - The seating arrangement appears to be minimal, with both plates sitting on a flat surface. Without detailed visual information on the entire space, the spacing between tables and seating positions cannot be accurately assessed.\n\n- **Decor Styles**:\n  - The decor style seems to be modern and minimalist, with a focus on the food presentation. The neutral background and white plates contribute to this aesthetic. \n\n- **Lighting Style**:\n  - There is no indication of specific lighting fixtures in the image, but the overall presentation suggests that the lighting could be well-moded to highlight the food.\n\n- **Facilities**:\n  - The image does not clearly show any specific facilities, such as charging stations, bookshelves, or prayer rooms.\n\n- **Power Outlet Availability**:\n  - There is an insufficient amount of power outlets visible in the image, which is why this detail is considered scarce in terms of power outplug availability.\n\n- **Notable Work-Friendly Features**:\n  - The image does not provide any notable work-friendly features, such as work stations or specific facilities designed for employees. However, the presence of two plates of food suggests it is a social dining setup.",

The plate contains fried rice, which appears to be seasoned with various ingredients such as vegetables, possibly fish or shrimp, and has bits of chili and garlic oil. There are also a few pieces of potato puffs, a slice of tomato, and a small portion of leafy greens. The table seems to be a simple establishment, with no visible decorations or seating arrangements in the visible area. The lighting appears to be natural, suggesting the setting is likely during daytime. There are no visible power outlets, and no other notable amenities like charging stations or bookshelves are visible in the photo. Given the lack of visible seating arrangements and space, it is not possible to determine the exact capacity size of the establishment. The focal point of the image is the food, which seems to be presented without additional dining setting elements, suggesting a casual dining experience.",

Served on a white plate, the fried rice appears to be seasoned with various toppings including shredded chicken, cucumber slices, and a sprig of lettuce. The presentation is simple and inviting, with a hint of green and white contrast that makes the fried rice stand out.\n\nThe table is a dark brown color, providing a neutral backdrop for the meal. At the top edge of the image, part of a glass bottle can be seen, suggesting the presence of a beverage or condiment, though it's not the central focus of the image.

    "cbbd81aaa7bbae37cccd1083358cf4355c6f8f1f9adbf074e3abf72aa98c0f36": "The photo shows a sidewalk cafe with an outdoor seating area. The facade of the building is made of white brick, with an overhead canopy providing shade. Two small black security cameras are mounted on the wall, one just above a window and the other further along the wall. A small potted plant is situated on a ledge in front of the window. On the sidewalk, there are two wooden tables paired with chairs made of dark wood. To the right, a lush tropical plant adds a touch of greenery. The ground-level entrance is marked by a set of dark wooden doors. The signage above the entrance indicates the name \"Morton's,\" possibly referring to the name of the establishment below or the brand of the tableware. The sign is simple, round, and white, with black text that reads \"STROOM COFFEE.\" The natural light enters the building via large windows positioned high on the wall, suggesting a well-lit and inviting interior. The tables are relatively spaced out, with a distance of about 4-5 feet between them, creating a comfortable and open atmosphere. The decor is clean and minimalistic, focusing on natural materials and contemporary design. There is no visible outdoor seating area in the image, but the setup suggests ample opportunities for seating. The ambiance appears calm, with no visible patrons, likely making it ideal for a relaxed morning or afternoon in a coffee-centric setting. Although specific details of books or charging stations are not visible, the clean and modern design suggests a modern cafe likely equipped with these amenities. There are no power outlets visibly accessible within the frame of the photo, so it would be advisable to inspect the cafe for this feature to ensure power availability for electronic devices.

  "final_raw_summary": "<think>\r\nOkay, I need to map the information from the provided text into the CafeProfile schema. Let me start by reading through the user's input carefully.\n\nFirst, the name of the cafe is mentioned as \"STROM COFFEE\" on the sign. So that's the name field. The location is a sidewalk cafe with outdoor seating, but the exact address isn't given. Maybe I can note that as \"sidewalk cafe near Morton's\" or similar. Wait, the user might not have specific coordinates, so maybe leave location as null unless specified.\n\nCapacity size: The text mentions \"two wooden tables paired with chairs made of dark wood.\" It also says there are two tables spaced about 4-5 feet apart. The capacity seems small, but in the schema, the capacity_size is an enum with 'small', 'medium', 'large'. Since there's only two tables, maybe 'small'?\n\nDecor styles: The decor is described as clean and minimalistic, using natural materials and contemporary design. So the decor_style should be 'minimalist'.\n\nLighting style: Natural light comes through large windows, and there are pendant lights. So lighting_style would be 'natural' or 'mixed'? Maybe 'natural' since it's mainly natural light.\n\nNoise level: The ambiance is calm with no visible patrons. So noise_level is probably 'quiet'.\n\nPower outlet availability: Not visible in the photo, but the schema has AvailabilityLevel. Since they aren't visible, maybe 'unavailable'? But the user mentioned that the clean and modern design suggests charging stations might be present. However, the text says \"no power outlets visibly accessible within the frame of the photo\". So maybe 'unavailable' or 'limited'? Wait, the enum includes 'unavailable', 'limited', 'good', 'abundant'. Since they aren't visible, perhaps 'unavailable'?\n\nWork-friendly features: The setup is relaxed and comfortable for a coffee break. Maybe mention 'quiet environment' or 'cozy atmosphere' as work-friendly features.\n\nFacilities: The text mentions outdoor seating, but the image doesn't show it. However, the description says \"suggestions ample opportunities for seating,\" so maybe include 'outdoor_seating'? Also, the sign is there, but not sure if that's a facility. Maybe 'charging_stations' is present due to modern design, even though not visible in the photo? Or is that just an assumption?\n\nFulfillment methods: The cafe serves coffee and possibly other beverages. The text mentions \"coffee-centric setting,\" so maybe 'dine_in' and 'curbside_pickup'? But the image shows outdoor tables, so maybe 'dine_in' is possible. However, the schema requires fulfillment_methods as an array of FulfillmentMethod enums.\n\nService type: Coffee, probably. So ServiceType would be 'coffee'.\n\nSpacing level: The tables are spaced 4-5 feet apart, which is comfortable. So spacing_level is 'comfortable'.\n\nNoise level again: Quiet, as per ambiance.\n\nStaff friendliness isn't mentioned, so maybe leave it as null or set to 'fair' if we assume it's not specified?\n\nWait, the user instructions said to use the schema and map the information from the text. The text doesn't mention staff friendliness, so that field should be null.\n\nSo putting this all together:\n\nName: \"STROM COFFEE\"\n\nCapacity size: small (since two tables)\n\nDecor style: minimalist\n\nLighting style: natural (as per large windows and natural light)\n\nNoise level: quiet\n\nPower outlet availability: unavailable (not visible in the photo, but maybe they are present elsewhere?)\n\nWork-friendly features: [\"quiet environment\", \"cozy atmosphere\"]\n\nFacilities: [\"outdoor_seating\"] (even though not visible, the setup suggests it's possible)\n\nFulfillment methods: ['dine_in', 'curbside_pickup']?\n\nBut the text says it's a sidewalk cafe with outdoor seating. Maybe they serve dine-in and takeout? Or delivery? The schema allows for any of the enums. Since it's a sidewalk cafe, maybe only dine-in is possible? But the user didn't specify.\n\nAlternatively, since the image shows tables on the sidewalk, maybe it's for dine-in. However, the text says \"no visible patrons,\" so maybe it's open for dining. So maybe 'dine_in' and 'curbside_pickup'?\n\nI think that's the best approach.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"STROM COFFEE\",\n  \"location\": \"Sidewalk cafe near Morton's\",\n  \"capacity_size\": \"small\",\n  \"decor_styles\": [\"minimalist\"],\n  \"lighting_style\": \"natural\",\n  \"noise_level\": \"quiet\",\n  \"power_outlet_availability\": \"unavailable\",\n  \"work_friendly_features\": [\"quiet environment\", \"cozy atmosphere\"],\n  \"facilities\": [\"outdoor_seating\"],\n  \"fulfillment_methods\": [\"dine_in\", \"curbside_pickup\"],\n  \"service_type\": \"coffee\",\n  \"spacing_level\": \"comfortable\",\n  \"seating_types\": [\"tables\"],\n  \"decor_styles\": [\"minimalist\"],\n  \"lighting_style\": \"natural\",\n  \"noise_level\": \"quiet\"\n}",
