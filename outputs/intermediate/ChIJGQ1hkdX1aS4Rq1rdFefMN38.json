The large windows also provide an open feel to the space, adding a touch of natural light without making it too overexposed.\n\nThe decor style appears contemporary and functional. The use of simple wooden furniture and a large mural adds a artistic yet welcoming atmosphere to the space.\n\nPower outlets are not visible in this shot, possibly indicating a more traditional approach to the seating area, where seating arrangements are planned to allow adequate movement around the spaces without needing to reach power outlets.\n\nThe seating areas are spread out enough that the distance between tables does not feel overcrowded, making the space appear spacious and inviting.

The foreground features a counter with various coffee-related items, including coffee beans, a coffee grinder, and a tablet device, likely used for order processing. The counter also has a small selection of beverages, such as bottled tea and water. The area behind the counter is equipped with a high-end coffee machine, indicating the cafe's emphasis on a premium coffee experience.\n\nA large board with a food menu is prominently displayed on the wall behind the counter. The menu includes various coffee options like black coffee and non-coffee drinks such as tea, as well as sections for Korean dishes like korean chicken taljum and spicy cold tofu. The menu also features smaller sections for snacks and drinks, including items like Korean spicy kimchi stew and various beverages.\n\nThe seating area consists of a small booth or area with wooden furniture, including tables and chairs, providing a cozy spot for patrons to enjoy their food and beverages. The space appears to be relatively small, but the booth offers a bit more privacy compared to open seating.\n\nThe decor style emphasizes a contemporary and industrial vibe, with exposed beams and a mix of modern and rustic elements. This is further accentuated by the use of concrete panels and wood throughout the space.\n\nThe lighting style is a combination of industrial-style fixtures, hanging above the counter and booths, and natural light coming in through large windows positioned along the sides of the cafe. The natural light adds warmth to the space and highlights the decor.\n\nNo specific amenities such as outdoor seating, bookshelves, game areas, prayer rooms, or charging stations are visible in the image. However, the overall setup suggests a casual yet comfortable environment.\n\nIn terms of power outlets, the image does not show any visible power outlets, so this aspect remains undetermined.

Through the window, some artificial lighting fixtures can be seen, suggesting the presence of lights inside the establishment. The background outside the window shows a natural setting with trees and possibly a street visible through the window, hinting that this coffeehouse might have an outdoor seating option.\n\nThe overall area seems small and could support a modest amount of seating. With both people and the furniture visible from this perspective, it can be inferred that the seating capacity might be limited, depending on how close the chairs and tables are placed. There are no immediately visible details of chairs or tables, but given the context, it is clear the seating is simple, likely made of wood or plastic given the outdoor setting, with minimal comfort levels to accommodate multiple customers.\n\nThe space has a simple and clean design typical of many casual coffeehouses.

  "final_raw_summary": "<think>\r\nOkay, I need to generate a CafeProfile based on the user's input. Let me start by going through all the information provided in the inputs.\n\nFirst, the name of the place is mentioned as \"Jazz & Brews Caf\u00e9\". That's straightforward. The location isn't specified here, but maybe I can leave it as null since it's not given. The rating and user ratings aren't provided either, so those will be null too.\n\nNext, the food and beverages options: they mention coffee, dessert, and possibly other items like iced drinks. So ServiceType would include coffee, dessert, and maybe others if applicable. Let me check each input again. There's a mention of iced coffee, mint green drink, and trifle as desserts. Also, there's a reference to a pour-over coffee setup and branded jars. So the service types should be coffee, dessert, and possibly breakfast or lunch if any, but since it's a caf\u00e9, maybe just coffee and dessert.\n\nFulfillment methods: The inputs mention dine-in, takeout, delivery, and curbside pickup. But looking at the user's descriptions, they talk about seating arrangements, so likely dine-in is available. However, the user didn't specify if takeout or delivery is possible, but since it's a caf\u00e9, I should include all options unless stated otherwise. Wait, in one of the inputs, there's a mention of \"dine_in\" and \"takeout\", so maybe those are the fulfillment methods.\n\nCapacity size: The descriptions talk about round tables with chairs arranged close together, indicating moderate capacity. So capacity_size would be medium.\n\nSeating types: The input mentions round wooden tables, black steel frame chairs. So seating_types would include tables and benches? Or just tables? Wait, the inputs mention \"round table\" and \"sturdy black steel frame chairs\", so maybe seating_types are tables and counter (if there's a counter area). But in one of the descriptions, it says \"counter\" as a seating type. Let me check again. In one input: \"seating is furnished with sturdy, black steel frame chairs... arranged close enough to a round wooden table\". So seating types would be tables and maybe counter if applicable.\n\nSpacing level: The description says there are no visible gaps between the chairs, so it's comfortable or cramped? Since they're arranged closely but not too tight, maybe spacing_level is comfortable.\n\nDecor styles: The inputs mention modern, rustic, and minimalistic elements. For example, \"modern and simple\", \"rustic wooden lids\", \"minimalist\" decor. So decor_styles would include modern, rustic, and minimalist.\n\nLighting style: The inputs describe ambient lighting with overhead lights and possibly natural light, so lighting_style is natural or mixed? Wait, one input says \"ambient, likely using a combination of overhead lights and possibly natural light\", which might be mixed, but another mentions \"natural\" light. Maybe the lighting_style is natural.\n\nNoise level: The caf\u00e9 is described as cozy, with no mention of loud noises, so noise_level would be quiet or moderate? Since it's a caf\u00e9, maybe moderate if there are other people around, but given the description, perhaps moderate.\n\nWifi quality: Not mentioned, so leave as null.\n\nPower outlet availability: In some inputs, power outlets are visible, others not. The user mentions \"no visible power outlets in the image\", so power_outlet_availability is limited or unavailable? Wait, one input says there are power outlets near the counter and seating area, so maybe available. But another input says no visible power outlets. Hmm, need to check all inputs again. One of the inputs says \"there are no visible power outlets in the image\", so power_outlet_availability is limited or unavailable? The schema has AvailabilityLevel with options like 'unavailable', 'limited', etc. Since there's a mention of power outlets near counter and seating area in one input, but others say none, maybe it's limited.\n\nWork-friendly features: The inputs mention that the caf\u00e9 has a clean layout, efficient operations, possibly conducive to work. So work_friendly_features could include \"clean layout\", \"efficient service\", \"comfortable seating\".\n\nFacilities: The user mentioned no outdoor seating in some descriptions but others talk about an outdoor area. Wait, one input mentions \"outdoor seating\" as a facility type? Let me check. In the first input, it's described as having \"an outdoor seating area\" or not? Hmm, actually, looking back, there's a mention of \"a round wooden table... with no visible gaps between them, indicating efficient space utilization\". Also, in one of the inputs, there's an image that includes an outdoor setting. But the user didn't explicitly state if outdoor seating is available. However, given that the description mentions a round table and chairs arranged close together, maybe it's an indoor caf\u00e9. So facilities might not include outdoor_seating unless specified. Wait, but in one input, the description says \"the area does not seem overly crowded, suggesting it has moderate capacity, suitable for casual gatherings or small groups.\" Maybe no outdoor seating.
