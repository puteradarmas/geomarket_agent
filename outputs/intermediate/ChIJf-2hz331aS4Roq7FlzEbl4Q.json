No seating arrangement is visible beyond a counter and a few chairs next to it.\n\nSeating Types: There are a few chairs and stools arranged at the counter and against the wall, designed for quick seating and a casual atmosphere.\n\nSpacing Level: The tables and chairs are closely packed, with no significant empty space, which might be functional but could limit movement and access to seating. No specific details about the floor space or how close the counters are to the walls.\n\nDecor Styles: The decor is modern and minimalist, with a light-colored wall color, wooden shelves, and simple fixtures hanging from the ceiling. There are a few posters on the walls and a menu board on the wall, adding a unique element to the decor.\n\nLighting Style: The lighting is neutral and ambient, with hanging pendant lights providing illumination and a cozy feel.

There is a selection of small containers, possibly condiments, on the counter. No specific beverages like coffee or tea are visible. However, given the size and style, it is reasonable to assume that there might be coffee available given the typical caf\u00e9 environment.\n\n### Capacity Size:\nThe image shows a relatively small cafe area. The presence of a counter with seating and limited space suggests that the maximum capacity might be a few people. Given the layout with open space visible, it can potentially handle mid-high foot traffic at a time when the space allows multiple people to sit.\n\n### Seating Types:\nVisible seating furniture includes a couple of wooden stools placed near the counter. This indicates a limited seating capacity, with chairs being the primary means of occupancy.\n\n### Spacing Level:\nThe table spaces are narrow with each table being separated by a small gap, and the chairs are arranged closer to the wall, maximizing the use of space. This setup maximizes the seating capacity within available space. \n\n### Decor Styles:\nThere is minimal decor visible, primarily functional, with the walls being plain and the furniture in muted colors. Some decorative elements like wall stickers on the left can be seen, but these are sparse and lack vibrancy and volume.\n\n### Lighting Style:\nThe lighting appears natural, coming from the open doorway and window, with no artificial lights visible in the primary area. There are no overhead lights to be seen, and the lighting is likely to vary in intensity based on the sunlight's availability.\n\n### Facilities:\nThere are no visible outside seating, which is why it might be a 'no outdoor seating' type of establishment. There are no visible books or devices, not much equipment other than basic counters and stools, suggesting this is a simple, casual area without extensive amenities.\n\n### Power Outlet Availability:\nThere appear to be a few power outlets available, sufficient for basic kitchen needs and perhaps basic devices like a mobile phone charger, if any, but without seeing a broader extent.\n\n### Notable Work-Friendly Features:\nThe focus seems primarily on coffee culture, but there is potential for a cozy vibe with the minimal decor and simple seating arrangement. No visible equipment indicates no obvious office-like features, but this can easily change with modern amenities that users value.",

However, the presence of only one table and one bench indicates limited capacity for dining, as it does not fully utilize the outdoor space provided.\n\nThe seating types visible are a bench and a table/podest combination. The bench appears to be made of wood and is large enough to accommodate several people comfortably. The table is a simple rectangular shape with an orange top, which seems to be made from a similar material as the bench for consistency in design.\n\nThe space is quite open and spacious, allowing ample spacing between the bench and the tree, as well as some distance from the wall panel. Natural light filters through the tree canopy, creating a bright yet intimate atmosphere suitable for a pleasant outdoor dining experience. The area seems well-lit by natural light.\n\nNo explicit amenities such as a bookshelf, charging stations, or a prayer room are directly visible in the picture, though the visible decor style suggests a simple and uncluttered design typical for cafes aimed at creating a calm environment for patrons to enjoy their beverages and food.\n\nPower outlets can be inferred to be present in this cafe, though the exact placement isn't clear from the image.

The focus seems to be on functionality and utility, such as the outdoor seating arrangement and the scooter, which is likely a common sight in cafe settings.\n\n**lighting_style (light fixtures and natural light):**\nNatural light appears to dominate the scene, with no artificial light fixtures visible. Thus, it's a predominantly natural light setting.\n\n**facilities (visible amenities):**\nThere are no visible amenities such as a charging station, a playground, or prayer rooms.

Is it scarce or abundant?):**\nThere are no visible power outlets in the image. Therefore, it is not clear if power outlets are available or scarce for customers.\n\n**notable work friendly features:**\nThe blue scooter suggests a possible delivery service, which could be a work friendly feature.

  "final_raw_summary": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to map the given description of the cafes into the CafeProfile schema. Let me start by going through each part of the input and see what corresponds to each property in the schema.\n\nFirst, the name of the cafe isn't provided in the input text, so I'll leave that as null. The location is also not specified, so maybe set that to null too. Similarly, rating, user_rating_count, opening_hours, price_range, one_sentence_summary are all missing information, so they should be null.\n\nFor food_and_beverages_options, the input mentions \"coffee\" in several places, like \"coffee shop,\" \"coffeeshop,\" and \"coffee.\" Also, there's a mention of \"dinner\" in one of the examples. So I'll include both 'coffee' and 'dinner' as possible options here.\n\nFulfillment methods: The input often mentions dine-in, takeout, delivery, and curbside pickup. For example, \"dine-in,\" \"takeout,\" \"delivery,\" and \"curbside pickup\" are mentioned in different parts. So I'll include all these as fulfillment_methods.\n\nCapacity_size: The descriptions mention \"small,\" \"medium,\" and \"large.\" From the examples given, some cafes have limited capacity, like a small table with two stools. So maybe set capacity_size to 'medium' or 'small'? Wait, looking back, in one example it's a small table with two stools, so that would be small. But another description says \"limited space for customers,\" which might be small. However, the schema expects an enum like 'small', 'medium', 'large'. So I'll check which one is more accurate. The input mentions \"small table and the proximity of seating to the wall\" suggesting it's a small space, so capacity_size should be 'small'.\n\nSeating_types: The descriptions mention tables, stools, counter, booths, etc. For example, \"two white stools around a small wooden table,\" so seating_types include 'tables' and 'stools'. But according to the schema, SeatingType is an enum with 'counter', 'tables', 'couches', 'communal', 'booths'. So from the input, 'tables' and possibly 'counter' if mentioned. Looking back, in one example, \"seated outside,\" so maybe 'tables' are the main seating type. But in another case, there's a counter. Wait, the first example says \"seated at a counter.\" So perhaps 'counter' is included here. However, the input might not be clear on that. Let me check again: the first part mentions a counter, but other parts mention tables and stools. But according to the schema, we need to pick from the enum. So maybe 'tables' and 'stools' are not in the enum. Wait, the SeatingType enum includes 'counter', 'tables', 'couches', 'communal', 'booths'. Since the input mentions tables and stools, but stools aren't in the enum. However, the example given in the schema's description says \"two white stools\" which is part of the seating type. But according to the enum, 'tables' are allowed. Maybe the stools are part of the tables? Or perhaps it's better to use 'tables' as the main type. So maybe 'tables'.\n\nSpacing_level: The input mentions that the spacing between tables and walls is comfortable, so 'comfortable' would be appropriate here.\n\nDecor_styles: The descriptions mention rustic, industrial, minimalist. For example, \"rustic and somewhat dilapidated exterior wall,\" \"modern yet simplistic,\" \"minimalist.\" So decor_styles should include 'rustic', 'industrial', 'minimalist'.\n\nLighting_style: The input mentions natural light in several places, like \"natural light filtering through,\" so the lighting style is 'natural'. But there's also mention of artificial lights in some cases. However, the schema has a LightingStyle enum with 'bright', 'dim', 'natural', 'mixed'. Since the main focus is on natural light, I'll set lighting_style to 'natural'.\n\nNoise_level: The input mentions \"quiet and private\" spaces, so noise level should be 'quiet'.\n\nWifi_quality: Not mentioned in any of the descriptions. So maybe it's unavailable or poor? But since there's no info, probably set to null.\n\nPower_outlet_availability: The input mentions potential power outlets, like chains and wires for charging devices. So availability level is 'limited' or 'good'. Since it's not clear if they are available, maybe 'available'? Wait, the enum for AvailabilityLevel is 'unavailable', 'limited', 'good', 'abundant'. The input says \"power outlets available,\" so probably 'good' or 'limited'. But in one example, it's mentioned that there are power outlets embedded in the wall, which suggests they are available. So maybe set to 'good'.\n\nWork_friendly_features: The input mentions that the space is quiet and private, suitable for working. Also, natural light is helpful for concentration. So features like 'quiet environment', 'natural lighting', 'private seating'. But according to the schema, work_friendly_features should be strings, so maybe include these as features.\n\nService_style: The input has mentions of counter service in some cases, but also table service. However, in the first example, \"seated at a counter,\" so service style is 'counter'. In others, it's table-based. But according to the schema, ServiceStyle can be 'counter', 'table', etc. So maybe 'table' if it's seat-based, or 'counter' if they have a counter.\n\nTypical_wait_time: Not mentioned in any of the descriptions, so set to null.\n\nStaff_friendliness: Not mentioned, so set to null.\n\nFacilities: The input mentions outdoor seating in several cases. For example, \"outdoor dining and drinking,\" so 'outdoor_seating' is a facility type. Also, in one description, there's mention of power outlets, but that's part of the power outlet availability. So facilities include 'outdoor_seating'.\n\nNow, let me check each point again to make sure I didn't miss any info.\n\nFood_and_beverages_options: The input mentions coffee and dinner (from \"dinner\" in one example). So those would be included as service types.\n\nFulfillment_methods: Dine-in, takeout, delivery, curbside pickup. All mentioned in the text.\n\nCapacity_size: Small (as per small table and limited space).\n\nSeating_types: Tables (since stools are part of tables? Or maybe just 'tables').\n\nSpacing_level: Comfortable.\n\nDecor_styles: Rustic, industrial, minimalist.\n\nLighting_style: Natural.\n\nNoise_level: Quiet.\n\nPower_outlet_availability: Good or limited. The input says \"potential power outlets available,\" so probably good.\n\nWork_friendly_features: Quiet environment, natural lighting, private seating.\n\nService_style: Table (since they are seated at tables).\n\nFacilities: Outdoor_seating.\n\nI think that's all.
