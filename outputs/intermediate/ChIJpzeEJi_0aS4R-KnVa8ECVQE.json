The sign above the entrance features a colorful banner with the text \"BERBAGAI JUALAN PESANAN\", indicating that various food and beverage options are available. Below the main banner, additional smaller banners show other menu items including \"Kopi\", \"Pembenihan\", and \"Bokken\". \n\nThe entrance area is relatively small, with a canopy providing shelter from the elements, but no outdoor seating area is visible from the exterior. On-street parking is available to the left, adjacent to a tree. The seating inside is not directly visible, but the presence of power outlets suggests a small restaurant or caf\u00e9 setting with basic amenities.\n\nThe decor inside seems to be simple, without any elaborate styles or decor. There is some natural light coming in from the windows, which help to keep the space well-lit. There are no additional facilities such as an outdoor seating area, books, games, a prayer room, or charging stations. The power outlets are present inside the shop, with a sufficient number available, suggesting adequate lighting and utility for power usage in this setting.",

The focal point of the arrangement is a large bowl of comforting noodles with a creamy sauce, accompanied by two boiled eggs, slices of bread, and a couple of boiled mushrooms. Beside it, two glasses of iced coffee and two cups of what appear to be chai tea are visible. There is a small bowl of chilli flakes for adding heat and a container of what might be honey or a similar liquid, possibly for sweetening the drinks. To the left, there's a plate set for a meal, though the dish isn't visible in detail.\n\nFrom the available information, it is not possible to determine the seating capacity or capacity size, as this aspect would require additional context such as a view of other parts of the dining area or available seating arrangements outside the current frame. Similarly, seating types, space between tables, decor styles, and the presence of external lighting cannot be accurately assessed from this single image.\n\nThe power outlet availability is not visible in the image, and thus, it is not possible to determine if power outlets are accessible at this location.\n\nNo notable work-friendly features, such as charging stations or specific types of work-related furniture, are evident from the image. The overall impression is of a cozy breakfast or brunch setting that combines both food and beverages, with a touch of casual comfort and perhaps a hint of cultural flavoring in the drink options.",

The exact options are not detailed, but it appears to include items like sandwiches, salads, and bottled beverages.\n\n### Capacity Size\nThe caf\u00e9 seems to have a typical dine-in capacity. Based on the visible space and the seating arrangements, it appears to accommodate a reasonable number of people comfortably.\n\n### Seating Types\nThe seating options visible include:\n- Wooden chairs with a vintage design, possibly bamboo, for a casual, relaxed feel.\n- Long wooden tables suitable for sharing meals or as communal dining spaces.\n\n### Spacing Level\nThe tables are spaced at a moderate level to ensure easy movement and interaction among diners. The layout includes both individual seats and grouped seating, promoting both privacy and communal dining.\n\n### Decor Styles\nThe decor features an Asian-themed interior with:\n- Traditional Chinese/Asian art on the walls.\n- Wooden and stone accents adding to the authenticity.\n- Hanging lampshades that may be traditional or have an industrial style.\n\n### Lighting Style\nThe lighting style is a mix of natural and artificial:\n- Pendant lights hang from the ceiling, providing ambient and focused light.\n- There appears to be ample natural light through the windows, suggesting daytime use. \n\n### Facilities\n- Outdoor seating is not visible in this image.\n- Additional visible amenities include charging stations.\n\n### Power Outlet Availability\nWhile the power outlets are present, the image does not fully depict their availability.

Tall tables with padded stools are positioned throughout the space, providing ample seating for all diners. The ceiling is adorned with vintage-style pendant lamps that cast a soft, ambient light over the wooden floors. These tables and seats are distributed evenly across the room, contributing to a sense of openness and ease of access.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor is minimalist and functional, focusing on the essential elements without any ostentatious trappings. Traditional wooden chairs and tables with metal legs combine with sleek, contemporary elements, like the hanging pendant lights and the modern lighting fixtures on the walls. The walls are interspersed with framed artwork and vintage posters, adding character and a sense of local history to the ambiance. This creates an environment that balances comfort with a touch of personality.\n\nThe lighting is a mix of artificial and natural light. The pendant lights mentioned earlier are one type of artificial light, while the rest of the space seems to be illuminated by natural light coming from large windows. These windows allow ample light into the space, brightening it during the day and providing ventilation when it\u2019s windy.\n\nGiven the lack of visible books, shelves, or any other specific amenities, we can assume that the power outlets might be scattered across the tables and chairs. It\u2019s not possible to definitively state whether the facility is power-rich or power-scarce, as these cannot be visually confirmed.\n\nNoteworthy is the work-friendly aspect of the caf\u00e9. The setup and decor both make the caf\u00e9 a pleasant place for working or studying since there are no distractions or excessive decor elements, and the lighting ensures a comfortable environment without the need for an external light source.",

At the center of the frame is a metal coffee dripper with a black handle, resting on a glass mug that has just finished brewing. The coffee is still running, with a pool of coffee visible on the glass mug, suggesting it\u2019s been brewing for a short time.\n\nBeneath the dripper is a small bowl with a metal base, likely used for holding water. To the left, there is a partially visible saucer with floral designs, which has some remnants of coffee. The background is slightly blurred but reveals a white ceramic chair with a printed or woven backrest. The chair appears to be positioned next to a table or counter.\n\nThe table area is visible, and it seems to be a small, intimate space, likely part of a cafe or coffee shop. The surface is smooth and appears to be a light-colored stone or marble, contributing to a clean and minimalist aesthetic. There are no visible power outlets in the area, and no visible books, games, or prayer areas.\n\nThe overall impression is that this is a clean, modern cafe with a focus on simple, high-quality coffee brewing. The decor is understated, with a touch of floral aesthetics, and the lighting is subdued, likely artificial, to avoid glare on the coffee setup. It seems to be designed for a quiet, contemplative coffee drinking experience.",

The d\u00e9cor includes both traditional and modern elements, contributing to a contemporary but relaxed atmosphere.\n\nSeating arrangements include a variety of wooden tables and chairs, which offer both comfort and an elegant aesthetic. The tables are rectangular and have marble tops, while the chairs are made of dark wood, adding a vintage touch to the overall look.\n\nThe layout of the seating seems thoughtful, with each table spaced approximately 3-4 feet apart, providing ample space for diners while maintaining a clear flow through the room. This spacing suggests an attention to comfort and a desire for easy movement, which is particularly useful for a dining area.\n\nThe flooring is tiled, contributing to a clean and sterile look that is beneficial for hygiene standards. There is no outdoor seating visible in the image, which might imply that the establishment is focused primarily on indoor dining experience.\n\nPower outlets are not prominently visible, which implies that this space does not require quick access to power outlets for any electronic devices or charging accessories. The lack of visible charging stations might suggest a preference for a more traditional dining experience, where electronic devices are more often left at home.\n\nOverall, the space seems to cater to both dining needs and the leisurely experience often associated with modern upscale restaurants. The layout, decor, and absence of traditional amenities suggest a modern setting that is likely both work friendly and customer-focused, though specific work-related amenities are not present in the image.",

However, the visible parts and the presence of menu pages suggest a typical small to medium-sized eatery.\n\n### Seating Types\nThe visible part of the cafe menu page does not specify the seating types. However, there might be tables inside or an outdoor seating area where the menu is displayed.\n\n### Spacing Level\nThe menu layout suggests a close spacing between different items, making individual sections visible one after another. The distance between the different dishes and their accompanying images appears to be about the same width.\n\n### Decor Styles\nThe interior design features are not visible in this menu page. This can only be inferred based on the typical decor styles of cafes which often include wooden furniture, simple and attractive color schemes, and possibly a warm ambiance to create a cozy atmosphere.\n\n### Lighting Style\nThe light fixtures in the menu page are not visible. The presence of glare and shadows indicates an overhead lighting system commonly used in cafes to ensure all items are visible for customers. The lighting is adequate to read the detailed text on the menu.\n\n### Facilities\nThere are no visible amenities such as outdoor seating, bookshelves, game areas, prayer rooms, charging stations, etc. The page is focused on displaying the menu.\n\n### Power Outlet Availability\nPower outlets are indicated by the presence of electrical images of plugs.

The entrance is marked by a traditional octagonal signboard with a red and green emblem at the top, followed by bold white letters reading \"OEY\". Below this, the text \"YANG CAFFE\" is displayed in a calligraphy style, suggesting the name of the caf\u00e9.\n\nThe entrance is flanked by two wooden doors, each adorned with multiple signs of different colors and sizes. The door on the left is partially open, revealing a glimpse of the warmly lit interior, which seems to house a cozy seating area with tables and chairs. Natural light filters through the windows and door, creating an inviting atmosphere.\n\nOn the right side, a red box-like structure with a red roof stands out. This serves as a red telephone box, painted in the same vibrant hue, symbolizing a touch of nostalgia. The booth is empty, suggesting it might store items such as maps, brochures, or promotional material for the caf\u00e9.\n\nInside, the coffee shop is brightly lit, with soft lighting from a small light fixture above visible at the top of the image. Natural light streams in from the window, suggesting it is likely daytime. Seating is provided with wooden tables and chairs, arranged neatly, although detailed numbers of tables are not visible. The overall space appears compact but welcoming, with comfortable wooden furniture suitable for socializing.\n\nDecorations are minimalistic but elegant, primarily focused on the walls. Several posters and notices are posted near the door and windows, adding character and possibly providing information or promotions. A sign on the right side mentions \"COFFEE AREA\", indicating it might be a designated hot beverage serving spot.\n\nGiven the compact size and limited visual space, it is challenging to determine the exact capacity size. However, the caf\u00e9 seems to offer enough seating for a small to medium group of customers, making it ideal for morning or afternoon coffee breaks. There is no visible signage indicating \"OUTDOOR_SEATING\", \"BOOKSHELF\", \"GAME_AREA\", or \"PRAYER_ROOM\", but there is an absence of a CHARGING_STATIONS, which is notable for a modern setting.\n\nRegarding power outlets, the image does not offer a clear assessment of the distribution across the caf\u00e9, as outlets or any specific amenities like chargers are not clearly visible. Power outlets may be scarce, although the caf\u00e9 appears to be electrically connected as the light fixture and possible electrical sockets are clearly visible.\n\nIn terms of notable work-friendly features, the image highlights the caf\u00e9's welcoming ambiance and the visible emphasis on social and community interaction. However, without clear signage or additional clues, it's challenging to define specific work-friendly features.\n\nIn summary, the caf\u00e9 is a charming, small, and likely cozy space with traditional and inviting decor elements, emphasizing a casual, coffee-centric environment. Despite the limited information available, it is evident that the setting is designed for social and restful activities.",
    "d5f7b2a4ccf7c5d47deb458d46ddf5acd4d035d3f48d01a4f2d20a1246324d8e": "The image depicts a casual cafe or lounge area. Here is a detailed description of the various aspects observed in the image:\n\n### Food and Beverages Options\nThe visible beverage in the photo is a latte made with frothed milk and coffee. The table also has a phone and a few neatly placed books, suggesting a relaxed environment for studying or leisure reading.\n\n### Capacity and Size\nIn the background, the space appears slightly expansive, with multiple tables set for seating around a central area. The visible part of the dining setup indicates that the table is large enough to accommodate more than one person comfortably. The seating arrangement hints at a capacity of quite a few individuals, giving the place a welcoming and open atmosphere.\n\n### Seating Types\nMost of the visible seating comes in the form of wooden chairs arranged around wooden tables, typical of a caf\u00e9 setting designed for informal dining or working. The chairs are sturdy and comfortably padded, enhancing the cozy ambiance.\n\n### Spacing Level\nThe tables are fairly spaced to allow for privacy and movement. The spacing is not extremely large but sufficient to accommodate an individual sitting, a table runner, and the items on the table.\n\n### Decor Styles\nThe cafe has an eclectic decor style, with traditional and contemporary elements mixed together. The patterned wallpaper and framed artwork on the walls add a decorative flair, complementing the modern glass window design in the background. There are also pendant-style light fixtures hanging overhead, providing soft and pleasant lighting.\n\n### Lighting Style\nThe lighting in the cafe is a mixture of natural light streaming in through the large windows and artificial lighting provided by the pendant-style ceiling lights, creating a well-lit and inviting environment.\n\n### Facilities\nNotably, there are framed photos or prints hanging on the walls, adding to the decorative appeal of the space. There are no visible signs of outdoor seating or gaming facilities, but there are several tables and chairs neatly arranged. A small, though unidentifiable, device on the floor near the latte might indicate wireless charging stations, adding a modern convenience to the setup.\n\n### Power Outlet Availability\nWhile precise power outlets aren't visible in the image, the layout and arrangement of seating suggests that the coffee shop has amenities that cater to user needs, such as power ports for charging phones, which could be inferred from the general setting and design.\n\n### Notable Work-Friendly Features\nThe overall setup of the cafe seems conducive to work, with ample seating, good natural and artificial lighting, and a relaxed ambiance. The presence of books and a latte indicates a calm and quiet space, making it an ideal spot for people looking to study, work, or rest in a relaxed manner.

  "final_raw_summary": "<think>\r\nOkay, I need to generate a CafeProfile based on the provided inputs. Let me start by going through each of the detailed descriptions and map them into the schema.\n\nFirst, the name isn't specified in any of the inputs, so maybe it's not required. The location is mentioned several times as \"cafe,\" but since the schema allows for a string or null, I can leave it as \"cafe\" if needed. But wait, the user might expect specific locations? Hmm, the inputs don't mention exact places, so maybe just use \"cafe\" as a generic name.\n\nNext, the food_and_beverages_options: there's mention of coffee, latte, books, and possibly other items like breakfast or brunch in one of the descriptions. But looking through all the inputs, there are references to coffee, latte, and some books. However, the ServiceType enum includes categories like coffee, breakfast, etc. Wait, in one input, it says \"food_and_beverages_options\" includes a latte (which is under coffee). Also, another input mentions books, but that's not a service type. So maybe the food_and_beverages_options should be coffee and perhaps others if mentioned.\n\nFulfillment methods: the inputs mention dine-in in several places. For example, \"dine_in\" is noted in one of the descriptions. Also, some mention takeout or delivery? Wait, no, looking back, only one input mentions \"takeout\" or \"delivery\"? Let me check again. In one of the sections, it says \"the table also has a phone and a few neatly placed books,\" implying dine-in. Another part says \"a small device on the floor near the latte might indicate wireless charging stations,\" but that's about facilities, not fulfillment method. So maybe fulfillment_methods is just [\"dine_in\"].\n\nCapacity_size: The descriptions vary. One mentions \"small\" in one input, another says \"medium,\" and another says \"large.\" Wait, looking back:\n\nIn one input: \"the space appears slightly expansive [...] capacity of quite a few individuals [...] welcoming and open atmosphere.\" So that's probably \"medium\" or \"large\". But the schema has an enum for CapacitySize as small, medium, large. Need to check which is correct.\n\nAnother input says \"a cozy ambiance,\" but not sure about size. However, given that one description mentions \"several tables\" and \"capacity of quite a few individuals,\" maybe \"medium\" or \"large.\" But there's an input where the capacity is described as \"small\" (e.g., \"a small, though unidentifiable, device\"). Hmm. Maybe best to go with \"medium\".\n\nSeating_types: The inputs mention wooden tables and chairs, so seating_types would be [\"tables\", \"counter\"]? Wait, in one description, it says \"wooden chairs arranged around wooden tables,\" so that's tables. Another mentions \"communal\" if there are shared tables. But looking through the descriptions, the seating types seem to be primarily tables and possibly counter. For example, one input mentions a latte on a table with a phone, implying tables.\n\nSpacing_level: The inputs mention \"tables are fairly spaced\" which is \"comfortable\" or \"spacious\". In one description, it says \"fairly spaced to allow for privacy and movement,\" so maybe \"comfortable\".\n\nDecor_styles: One input mentions eclectic decor style (mix of traditional and contemporary), another mentions rustic or minimalist. Wait, in the first input, there's a mention of \"eclectic\" decor style. Another input says \"rustic\" in one case. But need to check which are covered. For example, the description for the cafe with a latte has an eclectic decor style. So maybe \"eclectic\".\n\nLighting_style: Mix of natural and artificial. One input says \"natural light streaming in through windows and artificial lighting,\" so \"mixed\".\n\nNoise_level: The inputs mention \"relaxed environment\" and \"calm and quiet space\", so probably \"quiet\" or \"moderate\". However, one input says \"a calm and quiet space\", so \"quiet\".\n\nPower_outlet_availability: The inputs mention some have power outlets. For example, in one part, it's implied that there are power ports for charging phones, but other parts say \"power outlets may be scarce.\" However, the first input mentions \"scarcity\" of power outlets, but another says \"may be scarce\". So maybe \"limited\".\n\nWork_friendly_features: The inputs mention ample seating, good lighting, relaxed ambiance. Also, one input says \"ideal spot for people looking to study, work, or rest in a relaxed manner.\" So features like \"ample seating\", \"good lighting\", \"relaxed atmosphere\".\n\nFacilities: In some inputs, there's mention of charging stations (like the device near latte), bookshelf, but others don't. For example, one input says \"a small device on the floor might indicate wireless charging stations\" which would be a facility type. Another mentions bookshelf in one place. So facilities could include [\"charging_stations\", \"bookshelf\"].\n\nWait, in another part, there's mention of \"facilities\" like outdoor seating? No, but in some descriptions, there's no mention of that. However, the schema allows for FacilityType which includes things like charging_stations, bookshelf, etc. So if any are present, include them. For example, one input mentions a device indicating wireless charging stations (so \"charging_stations\"), and another has framed photos on walls (which is not a facility type but may be part of decor). But the facilities are separate from decor styles.\n\nSo compiling all this:\n\nName: Not specified, so leave as null or maybe use \"Cafe\" as the name? The schema allows for the name to be a string or null. Maybe leave as null unless required.\n\nCapacity_size: Based on description in one input where it says \"capacity of quite a few individuals,\" which would be \"medium\".\n\nSeating_types: [\"tables\", \"counter\"] if there's a counter, but maybe just [\"tables\"], since the descriptions don't mention counters explicitly. Wait, one input mentions \"a latte made with frothed milk and coffee\" on a table, so tables.\n\nSpacing_level: \"comfortable\", as per \"fairly spaced to allow for privacy and movement\".\n\nDecor_styles: \"eclectic\" from one input.\n\nLighting_style: \"mixed\".\n\nNoise_level: \"quiet\".\n\nPower_outlet_availability: \"limited\", as some descriptions mention scarcity.\n\nWork_friendly_features: [\"ample seating\", \"good lighting\", \"relaxed atmosphere\"].\n\nFacilities: [\"charging_stations\"] based on the device near latte, and maybe \"bookshelf\" if present. One input mentions framed photos or prints (not a facility), so not included. But another input says there's a bookshelf? Let me check again. In one description, it says \"neatly placed books,\" but that's part of seating. Wait, in the \"facilities\" section, there's no mention of a bookshelf unless specified. However, one input mentions framed photos on walls, which is decor, not a facility. So maybe only charging_stations.\n\nWait, another input says: \"Notably, there are framed photos or prints hanging on the walls, adding to the decorative appeal of the space.\" That's part of decor, so not a facility. Therefore, facilities may include \"charging_stations\".\n\nSo the final mapping would be:\n\n- food_and_beverages_options: [\"coffee\"] (since latte and other coffee items are under coffee)\n- fulfillment_methods: [\"dine_in\"]\n- capacity_size: \"medium\"\n- seating_types: [\"tables\"]\n- spacing_level: \"comfortable\"\n- decor_styles: [\"eclectic\"]\n- lighting_style: \"mixed\"\n- noise_level: \"quiet\"\n- power_outlet_availability: \"limited\"\n- work_friendly_features: [\"ample seating\", \"good lighting\", \"relaxed atmosphere\"]\n- facilities: [\"charging_stations\"]\n\nNow, I need to check the schema again to make sure all required fields are included and that the enums match.\n\nWait, the schema requires capacity_size as an enum of small, medium, large. So if the description suggests \"medium,\" that's correct.\n\nAlso, the work_friendly_features is an array of strings, so those three points should be acceptable.\n\nI think that covers it. Let me structure this into the CafeProfile object accordingly.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": null,\n  \"latlong\": null,\n  \"location\": \"cafe\",\n  \"rating\": null,\n  \"user_rating_count\": null,\n  \"opening_hours\": null,\n  \"price_range\": null,\n  \"one_sentence_summary\": null,\n  \"food_and_beverages_options\": [\"coffee\"],\n  \"fulfillment_methods\": [\"dine_in\"],\n  \"capacity_size\": \"medium\",\n  \"seating_types\": [\"tables\"],\n  \"spacing_level\": \"comfortable\",\n  \"decor_styles\": [\"eclectic\"],\n  \"lighting_style\": \"mixed\",\n  \"noise_level\": \"quiet\",\n  \"wifi_quality\": null,\n  \"power_outlet_availability\": \"limited\",\n  \"work_friendly_features\": [\"ample seating\", \"good lighting\", \"relaxed atmosphere\"],\n  \"service_style\": \"table\",\n  \"typical_wait_time\": \"moderate\",\n  \"staff_friendliness\": \"fair\",\n  \"facilities\": [\"charging_stations\"]\n}",
